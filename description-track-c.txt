1. Perform shortest path heuristic (maximum for 200 different terminals as origin)
	- Pick terminal as origin
	- Sort other terminals according to distance to terminal descending
	- connect each terminal via shortest path to origin and enhance solution
	- store best solution
	- repeat

2. Take best solution and perform local optimization
	- check best steinertree for every combination of 3 terminals (then 4, 5, ...)
	- perform until time runs out
	- Optimization of path between terminals resembles a steinertree problem
	- solve according to Dijkstra-Steiner (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0492.pdf)
